## Implementation Decisions

### Database Schema Decisions
**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Decision:** Rename `tenants` table to `publishers` 
**Rationale:** Better reflects the music industry context and business model
**Impact:** Requires careful migration and backward compatibility considerations

**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Decision:** Implement user audit fields (`created_by`, `updated_by`) on all existing tables
**Rationale:** Essential for user-level tracking and compliance requirements
**Impact:** Database migration required, all services need updates

### Service Architecture Decisions
**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Decision:** Separate services for Publisher, User, Account, and Permission management
**Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns, better maintainability, scalable architecture
**Impact:** More complex service interactions, requires careful API design

### Authentication Decisions
**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Decision:** Hybrid authentication supporting both internal and Active Directory users
**Rationale:** Supports different publisher types and user scenarios
**Impact:** Complex authentication flows, requires careful user provisioning logic

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Considerations
- **RLS Policy Impact:** New user-level RLS policies may impact query performance
  - *Mitigation:* Comprehensive indexing strategy and query optimization
  - *Monitoring:* Performance benchmarks before and after implementation

- **Permission Checking Overhead:** Frequent permission checks could slow API responses  
  - *Mitigation:* Implement permission result caching with smart invalidation
  - *Monitoring:* Track permission check response times

### Security Considerations
- **User Isolation:** Critical to prevent cross-publisher data access
  - *Validation:* Comprehensive security testing with different user scenarios
  - *Monitoring:* Security event logging and alerting

- **JWT Token Size:** Enhanced tokens with permissions may become large
  - *Mitigation:* Consider token compression or external permission resolution
  - *Monitoring:* Token size and parsing performance

### Scalability Considerations  
- **Multi-Publisher Users:** Users with access to multiple publishers need efficient context switching
  - *Solution:* Publisher context in request headers with proper validation
  - *Monitoring:* Context switching performance metrics

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Data Migration Complexity**
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption during tenantâ†’publisher migration
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backup strategy, staged migration, rollback procedures
   - Contingency: Full database restore from backup

2. **Performance Degradation** 
   - Risk: New RLS policies and permission checks slow down system
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, query optimization, caching strategy
   - Contingency: Rollback to previous version, optimize critical paths

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: User isolation failures or privilege escalation
   - Mitigation: Security testing, code review, penetration testing
   - Contingency: Immediate security patches, system lockdown if necessary

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Active Directory Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: AD integration failures or user provisioning issues
   - Mitigation: Phased AD rollout, hybrid authentication fallback
   - Contingency: Disable AD integration, use internal auth only

2. **Client Compatibility Issues**
   - Risk: Existing client applications break with new authentication
   - Mitigation: Backward compatibility layer, staged client updates
   - Contingency: Maintain legacy endpoints temporarily

## Lessons Learned

### Project Setup Phase
**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Lesson:** Comprehensive project planning and todo tracking is essential for complex multi-phase projects
**Application:** Detailed phase breakdown helps identify dependencies and potential blockers early

- Use type hints throughout the codebase

### Database Standards  
- All new tables use UUID primary keys
- Include proper indexes for performance
- Use JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- Include created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Implement proper foreign key constraints
- Use check constraints for data validation

### API Standards
- Follow REST conventions for endpoint design
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Include pagination for list endpoints
- Implement proper error responses with error codes
- Use consistent response structures
- Include proper OpenAPI documentation
