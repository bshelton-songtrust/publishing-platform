# Multi-Tenant Publisher Architecture Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
Transform Downtown Music Publishing's unified platform from basic tenant isolation to comprehensive multi-tenant publisher management with user accounts, granular permissions, and Active Directory integration.

## Business Requirements
- Support multiple publisher types: Enterprise (DMP, Sheer), Platform (Songtrust), Boutique (Spirit)
- Implement granular user access control with role-based permissions
- Integrate with Active Directory for enterprise authentication
- Maintain complete data isolation between publishers
- Support different access patterns per publisher type

## Current State
✅ **Existing Strengths:**
- Row-Level Security (RLS) at database level
- Tenant-based data isolation via `X-Tenant-ID` headers  
- JWT-based authentication framework
- Comprehensive catalog management (works, songwriters, recordings)
- Event-driven architecture with SQS integration

❌ **Identified Gaps:**
- No user management system
- Missing account/billing management  
- Limited role-based access control
- No Active Directory integration
- Basic tenant management missing publisher-specific features

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Models & Database (Weeks 1-6)
**Goal:** Establish new data model foundation with publishers, users, accounts

**Deliverables:**
- New database schema with publisher-centric model
- Core service layer for publisher and user management
- Data migration from tenants to publishers
- Enhanced RLS policies

**Key Files:**
- `/migrations/003_publisher_architecture.py`
- `/src/models/publisher.py`
- `/src/models/user.py` 
- `/src/models/account.py`
- `/src/services/publisher_service.py`
- `/src/services/user_service.py`

### Phase 2: Permissions & Accounts (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal:** Implement granular permission system and account management

**Deliverables:**
- Permission-based access control system
- Account and subscription management
- Enhanced JWT tokens with user context
- Updated API endpoints with permissions

**Key Files:**
- `/src/models/permission.py`
- `/src/services/permission_service.py`
- `/src/middleware/permission.py`
- `/src/services/account_service.py`

### Phase 3: Active Directory (Weeks 11-14)
**Goal:** Enterprise authentication and user provisioning

**Deliverables:**
- Active Directory authentication service
- Hybrid authentication (internal + AD)
- User provisioning and synchronization
- Group-based role assignment

**Key Files:**
- `/src/services/auth/ad_service.py`
- `/src/middleware/hybrid_auth.py`
- `/src/api/routes/auth.py`

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Monitoring (Weeks 15-17)
**Goal:** Complete integration and operational readiness

**Deliverables:**
- All existing services updated with new permissions
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security monitoring
- Usage analytics

    ├── accounts.py         # Account/billing
    └── auth.py            # Enhanced authentication
```

### Database Schema Changes
- Rename `tenants` table to `publishers`
- Add `accounts`, `users`, `user_publishers` tables
- Add `roles`, `permissions`, `user_sessions` tables
- Update existing tables with user audit fields
- Enhanced RLS policies for user-level access

### API Design
- Publisher-centric endpoints: `/api/v1/publishers/`
- User management: `/api/v1/users/`
- Account management: `/api/v1/accounts/`
- Enhanced authentication: `/api/v1/auth/`
- Existing catalog APIs enhanced with permissions

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero data loss during tenant→publisher migration
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing clients
- [ ] User isolation verified through security testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Active Directory integration functional
- [ ] All publisher types supported

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Migration Risk**: Comprehensive backup strategy and rollback plans
- **Performance Impact**: Query optimization and caching strategies
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security review at each phase
- **Integration Complexity**: Phased rollout with testing environments

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database with RLS support
- JWT authentication infrastructure
- Active Directory access for enterprise integration
- Existing catalog service APIs
- Event publishing system (SQS)
