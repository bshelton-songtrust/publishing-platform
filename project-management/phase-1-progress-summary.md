## Technical Architecture Delivered

### **Database Architecture**
```sql
publishers (enhanced from tenants)
├── accounts (1:1) - billing & subscriptions
├── user_publishers (1:N) - user relationships
├── roles (1:N) - publisher-specific roles
└── [existing catalog tables updated]

users
├── user_publishers (1:N) - publisher access
├── user_sessions (1:N) - session management
└── [audit fields in all catalog tables]

permissions (system-wide granular permissions)
roles (role templates with permission sets)
```

### **Service Architecture**
```
Service Layer
├── publisher_service.py (Publisher lifecycle & settings)
